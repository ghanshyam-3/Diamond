# Diamond Inventory & Polishing Management System is a full-stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application designed to help diamond companies digitally track and manage every diamond’s journey — from arrival, polishing, and performance analysis, to final sale. Diamonds are added by the owner in an in_stock state with real-life attributes (carat, color, clarity, etc.) and are only sent for polishing upon owner approval. Once approved, managers assign diamonds to employees, set per-polish price (earnings), generate QR codes/barcodes for tracking, and log the polishing process in tamper-proof records. Employees receive real-time notifications of new assignments, can update status when work is done, and access their personal dashboard anytime to see all work completed, their monthly/yearly polishing history, and detailed breakdown of both fixed salary and per-polish earnings. Managers can mark jobs complete, schedule due-date reminders, and handle salary payouts. Owners get a smart analytics dashboard displaying profit vs expense charts, total diamonds processed, employee rankings based on speed and quality, and monthly polishing workload heatmaps. Finished diamonds can be moved to a public Diamond Marketplace, where buyers can view diamond details, images, carat, price, quality, and purchase them — generating automatic PDF invoices. The platform ensures full transparency through role-based security, audit logs, multilingual support (English/Hindi/Gujarati), and AI-based performance suggestions, making it a modern, professional solution for digital transformation of the diamond polishing business
